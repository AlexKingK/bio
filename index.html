                <p>Johnny was known for his deep calm bass-baritone voice. The distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, which is characterized by train-sound guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness couples with increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark, all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname "The Man in Black." He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,"followed by his signature song "Folsom Prison Blues".<p>

                <p>Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His other signature songs include. "I Walk the Line" "Ring of Fire" "Get Rhythm" "Man in Black" "One Piece at a Time" "A Boy Named Sue"</p>
